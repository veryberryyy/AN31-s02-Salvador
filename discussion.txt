- Review the programming tools
	- Array
		- is a collection of elements of the same type stored in memory locations
		- one of the fundamental data structures in programming, used to store multiple values of the same type
		- array literal []
			- the size of the array is fixed upon creation and cannot be changed

			- syntax:
				type arrayName[arraySize];

				- declaration without initialization
					- allocates the memory but does not set initial values

					ex. int number[5];

				- declaration with initialization
					- sets the values of the array elements

					ex. int number[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

		- Accesing Elements
			- array elements are access using an indx with indices starting at zero (0)
			- syntax:
				name[index]

				int number[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

				//accessing the first element
				int firstNumber = number[0]

		- Modifying Elements
			- it allows us to change the value of an array element by assigning a new value to a specific index
			- syntax:
				name[index]

				int number[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
				number[1] = 25;

				//output
				int number[5] = {1, 25, 3, 4, 5};

		- Iterating through an array
			- common operation is to loop through the array to perform operations on each elements such as summing or printing them

				//print each elements inside the array
				for(int i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
					std::cout << numbers[i] << " ";
				}

		- Finding the length of the array
			- it determines the size of a statically allocated array using the sizeOf operator

				int size = sizeOf(numbers)
				cout << "The size of the array" << size;

		- Multidimensional Array
			- arrays to have more than one dimension

			int matrix[row][column]

			int matrix[3][4] = {
				{1, 2, 3, 4}
				{5, 6, 7, 8}
				{9, 10, 11, 12}
			}

			- access the 2D
				int value = matrix[1][2];
					value = 7
				// how access the element inside the matrix
